    "Drug abuse has been a prevalent societal issue plaguing the US society for the past decades, yet interestingly, different counties and regions seem to have significantly different drug abuse levels. There could be a plethora of reasons why a particular county or region experiences a drastic increase or decrease in drug abuse, among which include local economic landscape, healthcare service availability, education level,l and so on<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that there is a high comorbidity between drug abuse and psychiatric disorder/mental health crisis<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2), and the fact that financial stressors and local economic landscape significantly impact the psychological distress<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3), we believe the economic landscape(unemployment rate and economic decline) could potentially predict drug abuse rate. These predictions could potentially help us better prepare regions from drug abuse and public health crises, during certain economic landscapes.<br>\n",

    "  Based on our proposed question and data sets used, some ethical and privacy issues that may arise would be based on the privacy of those who are documented participating in drug abuse or have overdosed. Depending on the counties/locations we choose to study, certain biases may arise. Certain counties that are of higher economic status could result in economic data bias, which could alter how drug abuse data is documented (richer counties document fewer overdoses due to better access to medical support/rehab). Additionally, reporting bias could also be a factor, since not all drug abuse cases and overdoses are accurately represented. This is because many cases are not reported due to a lack of advanced healthcare, which is especially prevalent in rural or low-income counties with poor medical infrastructure, resulting in less accurate reports. \n",

    "  There are important equity and privacy issues that could be problematic when analyzing data in relation to drug abuse and the economic state of a county. For instance, even though the datasets used are all publicly available and grouped by counties, there remains a risk of re-identification, particularly in counties that are sparsely populated and where overdose events are rare. In order to counter this issue, our group will ensure that the data is collected strictly at the county level, and if there are smaller counties represented, the data is aggregated with others. Additionally, correlating drug abuse with economically distressed communities may stigmatize and raise concerns within these communities. We will address these issues by making sure to use neutral and non-judgmental language and only focusing on causal claims.  \n",
