    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Most of the data used in our project will likely be information from the county level, which means individual consent may not be directly required. This includes variables such as unemployment rates, public health statistics, and other demographics. However, if any of our data sources involve surveys, interviews, or healthcare records that more explicitly identify individuals, we would take greater care to contact people so they can opt-in or opt-out as research participants that clearly understand how their data will be used. A failure in doing so would violate ethical norms or privacy, and we would also harm participants’ trust with us.\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "  Based on our proposed question and data sets used, some ethical and privacy issues that may arise would be based on the privacy of those who are documented participating in drug abuse or have overdosed. Depending on the counties/locations we choose to study, certain biases may arise. Certain counties that are of higher economic status could result in economic data bias, which could alter how drug abuse data is documented (richer counties document fewer overdoses due to better access to medical support/rehab). Additionally, reporting bias could also be a factor, since not all drug abuse cases and overdoses are accurately represented. This is because many cases are not reported due to a lack of advanced healthcare, which is especially prevalent in rural or low-income counties with poor medical infrastructure, resulting in less accurate reports. \n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "  There are important equity and privacy issues that could be problematic when analyzing data in relation to drug abuse and the economic state of a county. For instance, even though the datasets used are all publicly available and grouped by counties, there remains a risk of re-identification, particularly in counties that are sparsely populated and where overdose events are rare. In order to counter this issue, our group will ensure that the data is collected strictly at the county level, and if there are smaller counties represented, the data is aggregated with others. Additionally, correlating drug abuse with economically distressed communities may stigmatize and raise concerns within these communities. We will address these issues by making sure to use neutral and non-judgmental language and only focusing on causal claims.  \n",
    "  <br> \n",
    "- [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Because we are working with county or state-level data, individual demographic disparities may be avoided. At the same time, failing to consider demographic patterns could allow biased model outcomes to go unnoticed. If demographic data is included for fairness testing, it would need to be handled carefully and ethically. We recognize that including protected group data introduces its own privacy and misuse risks, but excluding it entirely may prevent us from identifying unequal impacts. Acknowledging this tension is an important part of our ethical reflection.\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    "- [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Although we are primarily using publicly available, aggregated county-level data, we still recognize the importance of responsible data storage. Even public datasets can cause harm if altered, mishandled, or combined in ways that increase sensitivity. The datasets we use would be stored on secure systems with limited access only to the team members directly involved in the project. If any dataset were to contain more granular information in the future, stronger protections such as encryption and access logging would be necessary. We acknowledge that weak data security practices could undermine trust and create preventable risks.\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "- [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Because our project uses aggregated public data and does not collect individual-level identifiers, there is no direct mechanism for individuals to request removal of personal information. However, we recognize that the original data sources we pull from may have their own policies regarding data removal or correction. If our research were to expand to include individual-level data in the future, we would need to establish a clear process allowing participants to withdraw their information. Even when not legally required, considering the right to be forgotten reflects respect for individual autonomy.\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "- [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Since the data used in this project is publicly available and has been for a while, long-term retention may not pose a significant privacy risk. However, we acknowledge that keeping data indefinitely without purpose can create unnecessary exposure. A reasonable retention plan would involve maintaining datasets only for the duration of the research and deleting local copies once analysis and documentation are complete. Even if the risk is minimal, having a clear retention plan demonstrates intentional and responsible data stewardship on our part.\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    "- [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  We recognize that statistical analysis with our datasets alone cannot fully capture the lived experiences behind county-level drug abuse data. Our assumptions about economic decline and drug/substance use may overlook structural, cultural, or policy-related factors that contribute to these patterns. Without engagement from public health experts, policymakers, or even affected communities, we do risk potentially oversimplifying the issue. Even if direct engagement is not feasible for this project, we acknowledge that blind spots may exist in how we interpret and frame our findings.\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "- [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  We are aware that our hypothesis itself could introduce confirmation bias, especially since prior research or other findings can suggest a relationship to exist between unemployment and drug use. There may also be omitted confounding variables, such as healthcare access, education levels, or local policy differences, that influence drug abuse rates independently of unemployment. Additionally, some counties may have very low reported overdose rates, leading to imbalanced data that could distort model performance. Failing to account for these factors could unintentionally reinforce stereotypes or overstate causal interpretations.\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "- [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  We have a responsibility to present correlations carefully and avoid implying causation where it does not exist. Choices in visualization such as scaling, color schemes, or selective reporting of results in maps or graphs can subtly exaggerate relationships. We will be careful not to highlight only statistically significant findings while ignoring null results. Our main goal will aim to best highlight the data we’ve collected and cleaned with no other motives. Misrepresentation, even unintentionally, could contribute to public misunderstanding or policy misuse.\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "- [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Our analysis focuses on aggregated county-level data, so direct PII should not be present. However, we remain aware that combining multiple datasets can increase identifiability in smaller counties. We will avoid displaying small cell counts or granular breakdowns that could indirectly expose sensitive information. Even if the risk is minimal, protecting privacy remains a core ethical consideration.\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "- [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "  To ensure accountability, our data cleaning steps, modeling decisions, and analytical assumptions will be clearly documented throughout the steps of our project. Without reproducibility, errors or biases could go unnoticed and uncorrected. Transparent documentation also allows others to read, critique or build upon our work responsibly. If issues are identified later, having an auditable process makes it possible to revise findings rather than defensively justify them.\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    "- [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "  Since our overdose datasets are compiled at the state level, we are not working with individual demographic identifiers. However, state-level economic indicators and overdose rates may still reflect underlying inequalities. Variables such as unemployment could indirectly correlate with historically marginalized populations due to systemic disparities. Even if we are not explicitly modeling protected characteristics, we acknowledge that economic data can function as a proxy for broader social inequities. This means our model could unintentionally reinforce patterns that are rooted in structural inequality rather than individual behavior.\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "- [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Because our data is aggregated at the state level, we cannot directly test for fairness across individual demographic groups. This limits our ability to detect whether predictions would disproportionately affect certain racial, gender, or socioeconomic populations within a state. We recognize that this is a limitation of our dataset. While state-level modeling reduces individual privacy concerns, it also masks within-state disparities, which could hide unequal impacts.\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "- [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  In our project, we are trying to predict state-level overdose rates using economic indicators like unemployment. How we measure model performance directly affects how we interpret our results. For example, if we only focus on overall accuracy or average error, the model might appear strong even if it does a poor job predicting overdose rates in states with the highest levels of economic distress. Since those states are central to our research question, it is important to consider whether our evaluation metric truly reflects meaningful predictive performance. We recognize that the metric we choose influences what the model prioritizes and how convincing our conclusions appear.\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "- [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  If our model predicts higher overdose rates in certain states based on economic indicators, we should be able to clearly explain which variables contributed to that prediction. Since this topic involves public health and sensitive social issues, using an interpretable modeling approach is important. Overly complex models could reduce transparency and make it harder to communicate findings responsibly. We recognize that clarity and interpretability are especially important when findings could influence policy discussions.\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "- [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Our datasets are secondary sources from Kaggle, meaning we rely on how the data was originally collected and processed. We did not control the initial data collection methods, which may introduce unknown biases or inconsistencies across states. Additionally, because the data is collected at the state level, our data analysis cannot be interpreted at the individual or county level. We acknowledge that our model identifies correlations rather than causal mechanisms, and failure to clearly communicate these limitations could lead to overgeneralization or misuse of results.\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    "- [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Yes, we plan to continuously evaluate predictive performance based on appropriate statistical measures such as RMSE, MAE, and R2. Performance will also be assessed across subgroups such as county and income level to identify any potential disparities or bias with the model. We will monitor the concept drift by tracking changes in unemployment and drug abuse trends over time and make changes to it when data distributions shift significantly. \n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "- [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  We will establish a formal review process in which any concerns will be addressed and taken into account when creating our model. We are aware that drug abuse can be a very difficult topic in general, and we will ensure that if any concerns come up, we will edit the model to address this. For example, we could retrain the model to omit certain data if needed, or we could adjust variable weighting, and even remove problematic proxy variables. \n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "- [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  All models will be version-controlled so that the previously validated versions can be brought back quickly. If there is significant bias or harmful impacts, we will suspend outputs and replace them temporarily with descriptive statistical reporting. No fully automated decisions will be permitted, and human oversight will remain the only decision-making process. Consequently, this makes sure that the model can be safely paused or reverted while issues are investigated. \n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "- [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  There is a risk of discrimination and stigmatization during the application process because this project analyzes sensitive topics such as drug abuse and employment. However, to reduce the risj we plan to ensure that the model will only look at geographic level outputs and not individuals. By proactively identifying risks such as profiling and discriminatory use, we aim to ensure the model supports equitable public health rather than contributing to harm. \n",

    "Our group will maintain clear and consistent communication through text on a groupchat. It is expected that everyone responds within the same day whenever possible. We will also use the discussion section as a dedicated collaborative time as well as a weekly meeting on Mondays from 3 to 5 at Giesel, in which we will delegate the project work due that week. If any scheduling conflicts come up with any of the members, we will make sure to communicate that before the meeting day, and the rest of the group will send a text on the group chat detailing what was discussed and the other person’s job for the week. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of the assignments for the project will be split up evenly based on each of our strengths and skills to maximize efficiency, while still making sure we are all putting in the same effort. We will split up the tasks by volunteering during our weekly meetings. In addition to this, all assigned responsibilities and deadlines will be put on our groupchat so all expectations are transparent, and everyone is aware of what they have to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "If there are any disagreements on ideas or approaches, we plan to discuss them openly as a group and evaluate the options based on the project requirements first. If we are still unable to reach a collective decision, then we will rely on a majority vote to decide our next steps, and we will also seek out help from our assigned TA. If there is a conflict where a team member is not completing their agreed-upon responsibilities, we will address the issue directly by speaking to them and offering assistance when needed. \n",
