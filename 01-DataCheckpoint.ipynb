Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

    "    1. load the dataset \n",
    "    2. make the dataset tidy or demonstrate that it was already tidy\n",
    "    3. demonstrate the size of the dataset\n",
    "    4. find out how much data is missing, where its missing, and if its missing at random or seems to have any systematic relationships in its missingness\n",
    "    5. find and flag any outliers or suspicious entries\n",
    "    6. clean the data or demonstrate that it was already clean.  You may choose how to deal with missingness (dropna of fillna... how='any' or 'all') and you should justify your choice in some way\n",
    "    7. You will load raw data from `data/00-raw/`, you will (optionally) write intermediate stages of your work to `data/01-interim` and you will write the final fully wrangled version of your data to `data/02-processed`\n",
    "4. Optionally you can also show some summary statistics for variables that you think are important to the project\n",

    "This dataset contains drug overdose mortality data for counties in California obtained from CDC WONDER. Each row represents the number of overdose deaths classified using **ICD-10 codes**. ICD-10 is an international alphanumeric classification system used to identify causes of death. This analysis focuses on substance-specific ICD-10 codes including T40.0–T40.5, T42.3–T42.4, and T43.6–T43.8, which correspond to commonly observed drugs such as opium, heroin, other opioids, synthetic opioids, cocaine, psychostimulants, and benzodiazepines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset also includes broader poisoning intent codes with the columns *Underlying Cause of Death* and *Multiple Cause of Death* variables. Codes X40–X44 represent accidental drug poisoning, X60–X64 represent intentional self-poisoning, and Y10–Y14 represent poisoning of undetermined intent. The Underlying Cause of Death (UCD) identifies the primary cause initiating the fatal event, while the Multiple Cause of Death (MCD) provides additional contributing substances involved in the death.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geographic information is provided through the *County* and *County Code* variables, which identify the reporting county. These are captured by the Year and Year Code variables, which indicate the calendar year in which deaths occurred. CDC WONDER provided the reported death rates with the range of 2018 to 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outcome measures include *Deaths* and *Population*, representing the number of recorded deaths and the county population for that year. The dataset also reports a *Crude Rate*, defined as the number of deaths per 100,000 population. When death counts are small (typically below 20), CDC WONDER labels the crude rate as “Unreliable,” indicating statistical instability in the rate estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the potential problems in this data set in this dataset would be the statistically small crude rates. Some crude rates are miniscule that they are labeled as \"Unreliable\". This can become a potential limitation for analysis when working with the crude rate data. Another problem is the short annual range of 2018 - 2023. This small range makes it difficult to measure drastic spikes in overdose death overtime. The UCD and MCD are redundant variables because the ICD-10 codes already help group the drugs.  "
