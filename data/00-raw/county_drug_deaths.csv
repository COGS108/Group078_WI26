"4. Beginning with the 2018 data, changes have been implemented that affect the counts for ICD-10 cause of death codes O00-O99"
"compared to previous practice. In addition, data for the cause of death codes O00-O99 for 2003 through 2017 reflect differences"

"5. On March 11, 2021, the 2019 mortality data on CDC WONDER was updated with the 2019 mortality data updated by NCHS on March 4,"
"2021 to include corrected information for residents of Texas affecting 5 records previously coded to cause code *U01.4,"
"Terrorism involving firearms (homicide). The underlying and multiple cause of death codes for 5 records were corrected in the"

"6. The U.S. - Mexico Border Regions distinguish between counties near the U.S. - Mexico border in the border states of Arizona,"

"the U.S. - Mexico border), and 2) the U.S. Non-Border Region with the remaining counties of the selected four border states. The"
"Border counties selection was based on the 1983 La Paz Agreement:"
"https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-09/documents/lapazagreement.pdf.. (i.e., counties for each state which fall"
"within 100 kilometers of the Border). Statistics are also available by each of the USA border counties along the U.S.-Mexico"

"7. After the creation of the final 2023 dataset, North Carolina updated the cause of death information for over 900 death"
"certificates to include a cause of death code indicating drug overdose (ICD-10 underlying cause-of-death codes: X40-X44,"
"X60-X64, X85, and Y10-Y14). Jurisdictions can continue to update death certificates after the closing of the mortality file. As"
"a result, users should consider that the actual death count for drug overdose deaths for North Carolina in 2023 is over 4,400"
"deaths, with a crude rate of approximately 41.0 per 100,000 population, and an age-adjusted rate of approximately 42.1 per"
"100,000 population. These deaths will not be updated on the final mortality datasets."
